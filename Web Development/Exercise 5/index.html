    <p id="small-text" class="green-text"> HTML is like the blueprint for a webpage. It uses 
        tags to tell your browser how to display things like text, images, and links.
         Imagine it's like giving instructions to build a house by arranging blocks with labels.
    </p>
    <p id="medium-text" class="yellow-text">CSS is like the decorator for your webpage. 
        It adds style and colors to your HTML. Think of it as choosing the paint colors, furniture, and decorations 
        for your house to make it look just the way you want.
    </p>
    <p id="large-text">JavaScript is like the magic worker of your webpage. It makes things happen when you 
        click buttons, play games, or fill out forms. It's like having a robot that follows your commands to make
         your webpage come alive.
